				<p>Three spheres, colored red, yellow, and blue, are floating within a 3D space, along the X, Y, and Z axes. Each sphere is sycling through three different positions.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>They can be East or West from the center of the module (positive and negative X axis/left and right),</li>
					<li>They can be at the top or bottom of the module (positive and negative Y axis/top and bottom),</li>
					<li>They can be North or South from the center of the module (positive and negative Z axis/back and front),</li>
					<li>Or they can be in the middle of any of these axes (neutral or zero).</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Take each axis and each position in the cycle, and convert them into balanced ternary, where 3<sup>0</sup> (the "least significant" bit) is linked the first cycle and 3<sup>2</sup> (the "most significant" bit) is linked to the third cycle. The three spheres should have three numbers each, resulting in a total of nine numbers.</p>
